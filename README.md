The game is a browser‑based, augmented‑reality voxel builder that runs entirely from a single HTML file. When opened over HTTPS, it requests access to the rear camera and uses the live video stream as the background; if the camera isn’t available (e.g. when run from disk), it falls back to a gradient backdrop.

On first load it generates a multi‑tower castle in the center of a large grassy plane and automatically zooms the view to fit it. The player’s view is controlled by two on‑screen spheres: a navigation ball at the top right shows the current yaw and pitch, and dragging it rotates the camera; below it, a zoom ball lets you change camera distance and also rotate the scene. Two‑finger panning moves the viewpoint across the world, while pinch‑to‑zoom and a horizontal slider adjust zoom continuously. A status bar shows frame rate and the number of placed blocks.

The lower toolbar (which collapses into a menu on mobile) contains block selections—grass, stone, glass, wood, brick, road, sand, water, roof, window, door, stairs, torch and lantern—plus size options (1×1, 2×2, 3×3), height offsets, undo, redo, save, load, export/import, and voice‑command toggles. Blocks can be placed singly or in groups anywhere along the view ray up to 100 cells away, and they remain anchored in world space: when you look back in the same direction, your structures reappear exactly where you left them.

Tap on an existing block to remove it or, when Stack mode is enabled, place another block on top of it; gravity will cause unsupported blocks to fall. Fill mode lets you tap two corners to fill an area quickly with the current block type. Doors toggle between open and closed states on tap, and torches and lanterns act as light sources. A zoom‑extent button fits all blocks in view, and a grid overlay can be toggled to help with alignment. The world can be saved locally, exported as JSON (for sharing or reloading later), and controlled by voice commands for common actions (“grass”, “fill”, “undo”, “zoom in”, etc.).

With these features—augmented‑reality overlay, real‑time voxel rendering, a fully touch‑friendly interface, persistent placement in physical space, and a wide array of tools—the game offers a robust mobile sandbox where you can build and explore virtual structures anchored to your surroundings.
